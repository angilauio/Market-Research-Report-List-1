<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Prothesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve prosthesis market includes three primary types: Transcatheter Heart Valves, Tissue Heart Valves, and Mechanical Heart Valves. Transcatheter Heart Valves are minimally invasive devices implanted via catheter, reducing recovery time. Tissue Heart Valves, made from biological materials, offer a natural function and are less prone to clot formation but may need replacement over time. Mechanical Heart Valves are durable, made from synthetic materials, and suited for younger patients but require lifelong anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events.</p></p>
